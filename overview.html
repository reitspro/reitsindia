<h2>Returns from REITs & InvITs in India</h2>
REITs and InvITs are capable of generating high recurring income as well as capital appreciation for investors. Such investments have stability and investors also receive periodically recurring income (at least twice in a year). Additionally, the value of the units tend to appreciate over time along with the value of its underlying assets. For REITs, the recurring yearly income can be approximately 8 to 10 percent annually (pre-tax) with an additional capital appreciation of 5 percent per annum averagely.<p>
<i><h4>About Distributions, the payouts from REITs and InvITs </h4></i></p>
<p>The money paid to unitholders of REITs and InvITs is known as distribution. A normal equity stock holder gets dividend on the equity share held. In the case of owners of REITs and InvITs units, dividend payment is only one category in the total payment made. The total money paid out per unit held is called distribution, and parts of this distibution can be categorized as dividend, interest income, amortization proceeds or return of capital, rental income etc. This categorization has implications on taxation for the moneys received by unitholders. REITs are tax efficient investments and a substantial portion of incomes are tax free incomes for investors, depending on this categorization</p>
